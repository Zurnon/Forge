#Forge

##Forge is a large-scale project I’m building that will likely use both C++ and Python.

Forge is a programming language for creating other programming languages. The main idea is simple: you define keywords, variables, and values in a file, and Forge will generate an interpreter (and maybe a compiler in the future, if I get that far).

The language will start simple, with a basic syntax like:

keyword variableName = value


Over time, I hope to expand it into a powerful and flexible tool for creating entirely new languages.


##Goals
Enable users to define their own language easily.

Auto-generate interpreters or compilers for these languages.

Support advanced features like custom syntax, control flow, and data types.


##Notes

I know this is a big project, and I might be biting off more than I can chew—but I haven’t found a project idea that excites me this much, so I’m going for it!
